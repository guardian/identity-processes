# Identity Processes

A monorepo to hold various SBT-managed Identity services:
* [Eventbrite consents sync lambda](eventbrite-consents)
* [Formstack baton requests](formstack-baton-requests)
* [Formstack consents lambda](formstack-consents)
* [Payment failure lambda](payment-failure) This is surely redundant?
